# vestib-rehab

This app provides interactive rehabilitation exercises for vestibular therapy. Each exercise is designed to help users improve eye movement control and visual-vestibular coordination. Below is an overview of the exercises included in the app.

## Exercises

### 1. Saccades
**Purpose:**
- Saccades exercises train rapid eye movements between two or more fixed points, improving gaze accuracy and reaction time.

**How it works in the app:**
- The user sees several points on the screen (either stationary, random, or in a sequence).
- The user is instructed to quickly move their eyes between these points as they appear.
- Settings allow customization of the number of points, their distance, speed, and color.

### 2. Smooth Pursuit
**Purpose:**
- Smooth pursuit exercises help users practice following a moving target smoothly with their eyes, which is important for daily activities like reading or tracking moving objects.

**How it works in the app:**
- A ball moves smoothly across the screen, bouncing off the edges.
- The user is instructed to visually track the ball as it moves.
- The speed and color of the ball can be adjusted in the settings.

### 3. VOR/VMS (Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex / Visual Motion Sensitivity)
**Purpose:**
- VOR exercises help retrain the reflex that stabilizes vision during head movement, while VMS targets visual motion sensitivity.

**How it works in the app:**
- A large letter (usually "A") flashes on and off in the center of the screen at a set rhythm (beats per minute).
- The user is instructed to keep their eyes on the letter while moving their head side-to-side or up-and-down, depending on therapist instruction.
- The flash rate and color of the letter can be customized.
